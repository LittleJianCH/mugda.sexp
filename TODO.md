- compare with AA's paper
- learn about three-valued logic -- for the intuition of logic with neutrality

`Mod` has `arities` -- maybe also for define

example of higer order data where arguments can be function -- `Ord` in the paper

- to test `compareExpWithPatten` on `Ap` -- Axiom 2 of `Order` in the paper

# close to cicada

use `Neutral` -- instead of `Values.Var` and `Values.Ap`

distinguish `Datatype` and `Data` from `Values.Ap`

   NOTE The paper call `Set` we call `Type`.

   NOTE The paper does not use `Neutral`, `Var` and `Ap` are values.

   NOTE The paper uses `ApUnfolded` instead of `Ap`, I am not sure it is necessary.

   NOTE In the paper, `Neutrals.Var` is called generic value,
   and index is used instead of bound name.

   "A generic value k âˆˆ N represents the computed value of a variable during type-checking."

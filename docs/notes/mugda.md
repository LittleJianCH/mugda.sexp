# 2.2 Syntax of Mugda

Identifiers:

We assume the following disjoint sets of identifiers:

| Identifiers | Meaning          |
| ----------- | ---------------- |
| C ∋ c       | for constructors |
| D ∋ D       | for data types   |
| F ∋ f, g    | for functions    |
| L ∋ l       | for global lets  |
| V ∋ x, y, i | for variables    |

Elements of C, D, F and L will be called constants.
